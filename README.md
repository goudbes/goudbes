- My master's project consists of the following modules: [SCP CLI](https://github.com/dhis2designlab/scp-cli), [SCP Website](https://github.com/dhis2designlab/scp-website), and [SCP Whitelist](https://github.com/dhis2designlab/scp-whitelist).
- My latest project is [Nynorsk p√• russisk](https://github.com/goudbes/nynorskpaarussisk), a website with Norwegian (Nynorsk) mini grammar for native Russian speakers. :speech_balloon:
